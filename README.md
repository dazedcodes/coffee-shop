# coffee-shop
Grab a virtual coffee cup of coffee via a program written in Python. 

### Description
This Python program will calculate the cost of a custom cup of coffee at a gourmet coffee shop,
you'll choose your coffee size, type, and flavor, and the program will summarize and price your order.

Check out the order-coffee.ipynb file to see how the program works in sections. You may also work with the file to perform program improvements by downloading the order-coffee.py file. 

### How To Run the Program on Your Computer

1. Download the program.

2. Open the Terminal or Command Line, depending on your OS system.  

3. Direct to the program location. 

4. Type in the following command: python3 order-coffee.py

5. Order your cup of coffee ready and enjoy! 

### Program Improvements
The code to run this program is simple and a great start for those learning Python. 

You can expand on this program by creating a backend API with CRUD functionality and 
connecting it to a frontend that shows off your HTML and CSS skills. 

The backend API could resemble a user's cart or track orders for a barista to complete.
